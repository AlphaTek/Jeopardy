In order to play the game, first you must navigate to:
http://localhost:8080/A1_Wasif_Ahmed/login.html

Once you land on that page you will see a text input to enter your name. Please enter your name and hit the "Lets Play" button.

Now you're on the Gameboard. You may select any question worth any value from any category and start playing.

Something of my own:
I included an additional "oops.jsp" page which pops up when the player selects a wrong answer. It will display what the correct answer is. You can click on the "Go Back" button to return back to Gameboard.

Things I couldnt get working:
 
- I couldn't get to "congrats.jsp" which is my "You Won" page when all the buttons were hidden automatically even after attempting several counters so the way I worked around that was by creating an "End Game" button on the Gameboard. This directs the player to "congrats.jsp" where it will retain their score and their name along with a congratulations message.

- I did not get a chance to get Daily Doubles to work.
